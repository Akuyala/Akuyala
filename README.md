#### Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently in that weird inbetween stage between univeristy and starting my career? Like I know how to code, work in a team and all, able to (mostly) diagnose problems and give approiate solutions (or workarounds tsk tsk) but because I don't sit behind a desk for 8 hours a day I get overlooked? ðŸ™ƒ


- Currently working on a few projects, one of which is a microblogging/messaging webservice. a couple of others are in design/intial code stages, so will put more up here when they're more advanced.
- Am not a red panda, or a raccoon.
