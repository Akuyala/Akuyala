# Akuyala
#### Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently in that weird inbetween stage between univeristy and starting my career? Like I know how to code, work in a team and all, able to (mostly) diagnose problems and give approiate solutions (or workarounds tsk tsk) but because I don't sit behind a desk for 8 hours a day I get overlooked? ðŸ™ƒ

- Mainly use Typescript / Java / Python, branching out into Rust.
- Currently working on a few projects, one of which is a microblogging/messaging webservice. Another is an IT Asset Manager (think licensing, hardware). Also a coupley games written in Rust (very early stages here)
- message me for access to any of it
- Am not a red panda, or a raccoon.
