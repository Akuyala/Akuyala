# Akuyala
#### Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently in that weird inbetween stage between univeristy and starting my career? Like I know how to code, work in a team and all, able to (mostly) diagnose problems and give approiate solutions (or workarounds tsk tsk) but because I don't sit behind a desk for 8 hours a day I get overlooked? ðŸ™ƒ

#### Languages I use:
- Python / TypesScript / Java / Rust / C++

### Current Projects: 
### Yet Another Messaging Service (YAMS)
- Intended to be a self-hosted messaging & posting application.
### Asset Manager: 
- Intended to be a small application mainly to catalogue IT assets, licenses, SSL certs, the sorts.
