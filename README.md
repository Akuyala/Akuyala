#### Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently not in a software dev job, but like I need to be a formally titled developer to make software lol

- Currently developing a chat application, currently in pre pre alpha ( **there is some sembalance of thought gone into it and that's about it** ), will make the repo public once a minimum viable product is achieved.
- Am not a red panda, or a raccoon.
