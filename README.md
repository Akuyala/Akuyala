# Akuyala
#### Christchurch, New Zealand

Currently in that weird inbetween stage between univeristy and starting my career? Like I know how to code, work in a team and all, able to (mostly) diagnose problems and give approiate solutions (or workarounds tsk tsk) but because I don't sit behind a desk for 8 hours a day I get overlooked? 🙃

#### Languages I use:
- Python / TypesScript / Java / Rust

### Current Projects: 
### Yet Another Messaging Service (YAMS)
- Self-Hosted Messaging & Posting Application.

### Rusty Music
- Locally Hosted Music player
